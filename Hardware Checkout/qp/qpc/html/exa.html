General Comments</h1>
<p>The QP/C distribution contains many <a class="el" href="exa_ref.html">example projects</a> to demonstrate various QP/C features. Each example project is described on its own dedicated page that you can find using several criteria (see <a class="el" href="exa_ref.html">Cross-Reference</a>). The example projects have the following main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>to help you learn how to use QP/C</b> &mdash; the examples show the intended way of using QP/C features and structuring QP/C applications.</li>
<li><b>to provide you with a starting point for your own projects</b> &mdash; the examples are complete working projects, with correctly pre-configured tools, such as compiler options, linker script, debugger setup, etc.</li>
<li><b>to provide you with unit testing support</b> &mdash; the <a href="/qtools/qutest.html">QUTest</a> examples illustrate unit testing techniques both for the development worksations and for embedded targets.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>It is highly recommended that you create your own projects by <b>copying and modifying</b> existing example projects rather than starting your QP/C projects from scratch.</dd></dl>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="exa_sec_apps"></a>
Example Applications</h2>
<p>To demonstrate QP/C features on an embedded board, you need to create an application that does "something interesting". Instead of inventing this "something interesting" for each and every example, the example projects implement one of the three "example applications", which are described on the <a class="el" href="gs_tut.html">QP&trade;/C Tutorial</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="tut_blinky.html">Simple Blinky Application</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="tut_dpp.html">Dining Philosophers Problem (DPP)</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="tut_game.html">"Fly 'n' Shoot" Game</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of the game application, all other example applications can be implemented on a board with just a couple of LEDs. The game application is a bit more involved and requires a small graphic display on the board.</p>
<p>Beyond these basic applications for demonstrating and testing the various <a class="el" href="ports.html">QP/C ports</a>, the QP/C distribution contains all examples described in the book <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/psicc2" class="extern" target="_blank">Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, 2nd Edition</a>. </p><dl class="section see"><dt>See also</dt><dd><a class="el" href="exa_os.html">Examples for Workstations (Windows/POSIX)</a></dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exa_sec_boards"></a>
Development Boards</h2>
<p>While some provided examples can run on your <a class="el" href="exa_os.html">desktop computer</a>, most embedded example projects require special hardware in form of <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_sec_boards">Development Boards</a>, which you need to acquire to be able to run the examples. The boards chosen for the examples are generally inexpensive and self-contained with no need for external hardware (such as external JTAG debuggers or power supplies).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exa_sec_tools"></a>
Development Tools</h2>
<p>Most provided examples require special embedded cross-development tools, such as embedded compilers, linkers, debuggers and IDEs, which you need to acquire independently from the QP/C distribution. Generally, the examples work with the free (size limited) evaluation versions of the commercial tools. The examples list the versions of tools they were developed and tested with. Please refer to the <a class="el" href="exa_ref.html">cross-reference section</a> <a class="el" href="exa.html#exa_sec_tools">Development Tools</a> to see which embedded toolchains are used.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exa_sec_conf"></a>
Build Configurations</h2>
<p>QP examples <a class="el" href="ports.html">QP ports</a> are provided in the following three <b>build configurations</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Debug</b> &mdash; this configuration is built with full debugging information and minimal optimization. When the QP framework finds no events to process, the framework busy-idles until there are new events to process. The QS trace instrumentation is <b>disabled</b>.</li>
<li><b>Release</b> &mdash; this configuration is built with no debugging information and high optimization. Single-stepping and debugging at the source-code level is effectively impossible due to the lack of debugging information and optimized code, but the debugger can be used to download and start the executable. When the QP framework finds no events to process, the framework puts the CPU to sleep until there are new events to process. The QS trace instrumentation is <b>disabled</b>.</li>
<li><b>Spy</b> &mdash; like the debug variant, this variant is built with full debugging information and minimal optimization. Additionally, it is build with the QS trace instrumentation enabled. The on-board serial port and the Q-Spy host application are used for sending and viewing trace data. Like the Debug configuration, the QP framework busy-idles until there are new events to process.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section remark"><dt>Remarks</dt><dd><b>Why do you need multiple build configurations?</b><br  />
The different phases of embedded software life cycle pose different challenges. During the development and maintenance phase, for example, the emphasis is on the ease of debugging and verifying the correctness of the code, which require lower levels of optimization and special scaffolding code. In contrast, for releasing the code in the final product, the emphasis is on small memory footprint and CPU time efficiency, which require high-level of optimization and removal of any scaffolding code. To address these conflicting needs, the same source code is compiled into multiple <b>build configurations</b> that differ in the use of compiler options and activation of the scaffolding code.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exa_sec_qm"></a>
QM Models</h2>
<p>Many example projects contain code auto-generated by the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qm" class="extern" target="_blank"><b>QM modeling tool</b></a>. Such projects always contain the corresponding <b>QM model</b> file, which you can open in QM, modify, and re-generate the code.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The auto-generated files are saved as <b>read-only</b>. This protects them from inadvertent modifications, which will get lost when the files are re-generated by QM (or QMC). All modifications to the auto-generated code should be done in the QM model, not in the code.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exa_sec_3rd"></a>
Third-Party Code</h2>
<p>The QP/C example projects often need to use various additional code, such as MCU register definition files, startup code, device drivers, etc., which are provided by Third-Party vendors. All such code is located in the <span class="img folder">3rd_party</span> <a href="files.html">top-level folder</a>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>As far as possible, the code in the <span class="img folder">3rd_party</span> folder has been left unchanged from the original source. (Any modified code is clearly identified by top-level comments that detail the applied changes.) For that reason, the Third-Party code might produce <b>compilation warnings</b> in your builds.</dd></dl>
<p>The code in the <span class="img folder">3rd_party</span> folder comes from various sources, and Quantum Leaps, LLC expressly makes <b>no claims of ownership</b> to any of this code, even though some of the code might be customized or modified by Quantum Leaps.</p>
<dl class="section attention"><dt>Attention</dt><dd>The Third-Party software components included in the <span class="img folder">3rd_party</span> folder are licensed under a variety of different licensing terms that are defined by the respective owners of this software and are spelled out in the <code>README.txt</code> or <code>LICENSE.txt</code> files included in the respective sub-folders.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="exa_own"></a>
Creating your Own QP/C Projects</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important fact of life to remember is that in embedded systems nothing works until everything works. This means that you should always start with a <b>working system</b> and gradually evolve it, changing one thing at a time and making sure that it keeps working every step of the way.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind, the provided QP/C application examples, such as the super-simple Blinky, or a bit more advanced dpp or game, allow you to get started with a working project rather than starting from scratch. You should also always try one of the provided example projects on the same evaluation board that it was designed for, before making any changes.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The evaluation boards used in the examples are all very <b>inexpensive</b> and available from major electronic distributors (e.g., <a href="https://www.arrow.com/">Arrow</a>, <a href="https://www.digikey.com/">DigiKey</a>, <a href="https://www.mouser.com/">Mouser</a>, <a href="https://www.avnet.com">Avnet</a>), as well as directly from the silicon vendors (e.g., a TI board is also available from TI.com).</dd></dl>
<dl class="section remark"><dt>Remarks</dt><dd>Even before you acquire a specific evaluation board, you can always at least <b>build</b> a project that interests you on your workstation.</dd></dl>
<p>Only after convincing yourself that the example project works "as is", you can think about creating your own projects. At this point, the easiest and recommended way is to copy the existing working example project folder (such as the Blinky example) and rename it.</p>
<p>After copying the project folder, you still need to change the name of the project/workspace. The easiest and safest way to do this is to open the project/workspace in the corresponding IDE and use the Save As~~~ option to save the project under a different name. You can do this also with the QM model file, which you can open in QM and "Save As" a different model.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>By copying and re-naming an existing, working project, as opposed to creating a new one from scratch, you inherit the correct compiler and linker options an other project settings, which will help you get started much faster.</dd></dl>
