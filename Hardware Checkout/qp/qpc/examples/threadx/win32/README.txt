This directory contains examples for QP-ThreadX port running
on top of Windows (with the Win32 API). The examples use the
following ports:

1. Unmodified QP-port to ThreadX (qpc\ports\threadx)
2. Unmodified ThreadX port to Win32 (qpc\3rd_party\threadx\ports\win32)

The example demonstrates QP/Spy software tracing (the QSpy build
configuration). The QP/Spy tracing uses TCP/IP for the data transport.
