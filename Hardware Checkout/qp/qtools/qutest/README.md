The `qutest.py` package is a [test-script](https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest_script.html) runner for the [QUTest testing system](https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html).


# General Requirements
In order to run tests in the [QUTest environment]((https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html)), you need the following three components:

1. The [test fixture in C or C++](https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest_fixture.html) running on a remote target (or the host computer)
2. The [QSPY host application](https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qspy.html) running and connected to the target
3. The `qutest.py` script runner and some test scripts.

> **NOTE:**
The `qutest.py` script runner requires standard Python 3, which is included in
the [QTools distribution](https://www.state-machine.com/qtools) for Windows
and is typically included with other host operating systems, such as Linux and macOS.

# Installation
The `qutest.py` script runner can be used standalone, without installation in your Python system (see [Examples below](#examples-for-windows)).

> **NOTE:**
The `qutest.py` script is included in the [QTools collection](https://github.com/QuantumLeaps/qtools). Also, the QTools collection for Windows already includes Python 3, so you don't need to install anything extra.

Alternatively, you can install the `qutest.py` package with `pip` from the [PyPi index](https://pypi.org/project/qutest/) by executing the following command:

`pip install qutest`

Or directly from the sources directory (e.g., `/qp/qtools/qutest`):

`python setup.py install --install-dir=/qp/qtools/qutest`


# Using `qutest.py`

If you are using `qutest.py` as a standalone Python script, you invoke it as follows:

`python3 <path-to-qutest-script>/qutest.py <command-line-options>`

Alternatively, if you've installed `qutest.py` with `pip`, you invoke it as follows:

`qutest <command-line-options>`


## Command-line Options
The Python test scripts are executed by the QUTest test script runner 1qutest.py1 (typically located in 1qtools/qutest/ folder), with the following usage:

> **ATTENTION**
The `qutest.py` script runner command-line options have been expanded and changed at version 7.2.0. Unfortunately, it was not possible to preserve the backwards compatibility with the earlier versions.

```

  -l [LOG], --log [LOG]
                        Optional log directory (might not exist yet)
  -o [OPT], --opt [OPT]
                        xcob: x:exit-on-fail, c:qspy-clear, o:qspy-save-txt, b:qspy-save-bin

```

- `-x` - optional flag that causes `qutest` to exit on first test failure.

- `test_scripts` - optional specification of the Python test scripts to run.
If not specified, qutest will try to run all *.py files in the current
directory as test scripts

- `host_exe | DEBUG` - optional specification of the test-fixture compiled
for the host (host executable) for testing on the *host computer*.
The special value **DEBUG** means that `qutest` will run in the "debug mode",
in which it will NOT launch the host executables and it will wait for the
Target reset and other responses from the Target. If `host_exe` is not
specified, an **embedded target** is assumed (which is loaded with the test
fixture alredy).

- `qspy_host[:udp_port]` - optional host-name/IP-address:port for the host
running the QSPY host utility. If not specified, the default
is 'localhost:7701'.

- `tcp_port` - optional the QSpy TCP port number for connecting
host executables. If not specified, the default is '6601'.

> **NOTE:**
For reliable operation it is recommended to apply the short options without a space between the option and the parameter (e.g., 1-q192.168.1.100, -ocx1).


## Examples (for Windows):

```
[1] python3 %QTOOLS%\qutest\qutest.py
[2] python3 %QTOOLS%\qutest\qutest.py -- test_mpu.py
[3] python3 %QTOOLS%\qutest\qutest.py -ebuild/test_dpp.exe
[4] python3 %QTOOLS%\qutest\qutest.py -ebuild/test_dpp.exe -q192.168.1.100 -l../log -oco
[5] qutest -qlocalhost:7702 -oxc --  test_qk.py,test_mpu.py
[6] python3 %QTOOLS%\qutest\qutest.py -eDEBUG -- test_mpu.py
```

`[1]` runs all test scripts (*.py) in the current directory on a remote target connected to QSPU host utility.

`[2]` runs the test script test_mpu.py in the current directory on a remote target connected to QSPU host utility.

`[3]` runs all test scripts (*.py) in the current directory and uses the host executable build/test_dpp.exe (test fixture).

`[4]` runs all test scripts (*.py) in the current directory, uses the host executable build/test_dpp.exe (test fixture), and connects to QSPY running on a machine with IP address 192.168.1.100. Also produces QUTest log (-l) in the directory ../log. Also clears the QUTest screen before the run (-oc) and causes QSPY to save the text output to a file (-oo)

`[5]` runs "qutest" (installed with pip) to execute the test scripts test_qk.py,test_mpu.py in the current directory, and connects to QSPY at UDP-host:port localhost:7701.

`[6]` runs "qutest" in the DEBUG mode to execute the test script test_mpu.py in the current directory.


## Examples (for Linux/macOS):
```
[1] python3 $(QTOOLS)/qutest/qutest.py
[2] python3 $(QTOOLS)/qutest/qutest.py -- test_mpu.py
[3] python3 $(QTOOLS)/qutest/qutest.py -ebuild/test_dpp
[4] python3 $(QTOOLS)/qutest/qutest.py -ebuild/test_dpp -q192.168.1.100 -l../log -oco
[5] qutest -qlocalhost:7702 -oxc --  test_qk.py,test_mpu.py
[6] python3 $(QTOOLS)/qutest/qutest.py -eDEBUG -- test_mpu.py
```

`[1]` runs all test scripts (*.py) in the current directory on a remote target connected to QSPU host utility.

`[2]` runs the test script test_mpu.py in the current directory on a remote target connected to QSPU host utility.

`[3]` runs all test scripts (*.py) in the current directory and uses the host executable build/test_dpp (test fixture).

`[4]` runs all test scripts (*.py) in the current directory, uses the host executable build/test_dpp (test fixture), and connects to QSPY running on a machine with IP address 192.168.1.100. Also produces QUTest log (-l) in the directory ../log. Also clears the QUTest screen before the run (-oc) and causes QSPY to save the text output to a file (-oo)

`[5]` runs "qutest" (installed with pip) to execute the test scripts test_qk.py,test_mpu.py in the current directory, and connects to QSPY at UDP-host:port localhost:7701.

`[6]` runs "qutest" in the DEBUG mode to execute the test script test_mpu.py in the current directory.


# Generating Test Logs
As required for safety certification, the `qutest.py` test runner can generate permanent records of the runs by producing log files. This feature is enabled by the `-l<log-dir>` command-line option.

The various make-files supplied in QP/C and QP/C++ allow you to supply the command-line options for saving QUTest logs (by defining the `LOG=` symbol while invoking `make`), for example:

```
[1] make LOG=.
[2] make LOG=../log
[3] make LOG=c:/cert/logs
```

`[1]` generates QUTest log file in the current directory (`.`)

`[2]` generates QUTest log file in the `../log` directory (relative to the current directory)

`[3]` generates QUTest log file in the absolute directory `c:/cert/logs`


The following following listing shows the generated log file:
